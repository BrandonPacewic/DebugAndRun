# Debug and Run

Command line tool for compiling and executing a standalone C++ file. Useful
for competitive programming. Additionally this script also defines my debug
macro for testing (`DBG_MODE`). For more information on my testing macros check
out my [Competitive Programming Library](https://github.com/BrandonPacewic/CompetitiveProgramming)
and [Competitive Programming Templates](https://github.com/BrandonPacewic/CompetitiveProgrammingProblems/tree/mega/templates).

commandline tools.
